# unleashedtest
Write a piece of code in C# to convert any amount to its English currency representation in words.   Example:   Input - 1.15  Output - "One Dollar and Fifteen Cents"  Include all your code (with unit tests) and any supporting references that are needed to compile and run the solution.    Also include instructions for how to run/use your application, including any limitations or assumptions.   You may wrap the code in a web app or command line tool - whatever you prefer.
